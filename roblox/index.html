      <h1>Aim is coming to ROBLOX</h1>
      <h3><strong>Wednesday, JUNE 2, 2021 Aim Interactive announces they are developing new games for the ROBLOX platform.</strong></h3>
      <h3>Aim Interactive is now releasing new games to the ROBLOX platform in the next few months. Many developers have profited off of ROBLOX and with the massive growth of ROBLOX there are many new possibilities, and with the addition of AIM to the ROBLOX platform, we believe we can further make this company more of a "COMPANY".</h3>
      <h3>32 million+ users play ROBLOX daily, and this is huge opportunity for the future of game developers. There are 20 MILLION currenct experiences on the platform, and growing fast, as with their player count. This will give AIM, along with many other small companies/publishers, a chance to thrive on the platform and help ROBLOX become a better platform as a whole.</h3>
